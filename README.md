# Code Coffer

Code Coffer is a multi-page MVC application. I built code coffer in part due to frustration  of not having a localized source for all my code snippets and in part because I disliked how rough stack overflow looked. I created a code repository with multi-user functionality and support for public, private  and favorite content; the application was created with c# and entity framework.
